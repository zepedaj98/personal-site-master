Barrett demands a deeper commitment to learning, requiring students to work with faculty to complete several advanced projects on top of their regular coursework, culminating in a thesis project, similar to a Master's thesis, in which a student has to form a faculty commitee to help guide them towards a successful defense of their thesis project.

                 While completing my graduate degree from the <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/"> MPCS program at UChicago</a>, I became greatly enamored with cloud technologies, and by the time I graduated, I had decided I wanted to pivot my career towards this new interest. After a tedious job hunt, I determined that  <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://viasat.com/"> Viasat </a> was far and away the best to learn the ins and outs of an enterprise-scale cloud tech stack. Having only been with the company for about a month at the point of this writing, I have been nothing but affirmed in my choice.

                 Having just finished my undergraduate degree I was working for the real estate brokerage <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://asherchaim.com/"> Asher Chaim </a>as a junior software engineer. I was initially tasked with writing web scraping programs in Python and building out an SQL database to contain the scrapped data, but my job quickly evolved into designing and building the company's current website. With exactly zero web dev experience, I accepted the challenge. In just under 2 weeks, I learned HTML and CSS and had a basic website deployed (via Digital Ocean). In the weeks that followed, I added web forms with spam/bot detection, data collection routing directly to an external CRM as contacts, and moved the website’s deployment to Netlify (for Github support and simpler deployments). Today my project is still the primary company site, and has been expanded wildly. In my free time during this project I designed a few logos for the company, mostly for fun, one of which was picked as the company's new primary logo. For all of these efforts I was promoted to Full Stack Software Engineer and was made a Partner with the company. I am currently tasked with building company applications (mainly Java and Python), implementing new web features, building new sites for the company's expansion, and integrating new employees into the company tech-stack.

                  <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://www.heliosmi.com/"> Helios MI </a>is a quantitative trading fund that focuses on using the newest software innovations to maximize the returns of derivatives trading. At HeliosMI, I use Java and C# to design algorithmic stock and option trading strategies, connecting to Interactive Broker's API. I also collaborate in the development of the entire trading framework, and assist with the formulation of several trading strategies, researching and building a strong foundation in stocks, options, and the inner workings of financial markets. I also acquired a much deeper knowledge of Java and it's ecosystem including Spring Boot, Maven, JUnit, Hibernate, etc. In the past, I have back-tested stock trading algorithms using QuantConnect, mainly using C# and Python (also see, Stock Trading Quantified in my <a class="smoothscroll" href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a>), and back-tested option trading strategies using Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation, utilizing their paper-trading capabilities. I also have identified potential bugs and system improvements using JUnit tests and collaborated in the design of the underlying Order Entry system. This system is used throughout the company to communicate with the brokerage (Interactive Brokers). Finally, I used HTML and Jekyll to design the current iteration of the company website (see above), and used Netlify and AWS (Route 53, S3) to deploy the site to the company domain.

            <p>All my life I've been a fast learner, and have enjoyed experiences working in a variety of environments, whether that be individually in a more fast-paced setting, or as a team in more collaborative workspaces. As a leader, I try to bring the best out of everybody, encouraging everyone to speak their mind and facilitating any technical debates. As a team member, I work hard to fill my role and provide advice or assistance to anyone that needs it, and I'm not afraid to share my opinion if I believe the team is going in the wrong direction. <br><br>

			      <h4>Stock Trading Quantified</h4>
			      <p>My honor’s thesis was an exploration on the principles and popular strategies of algorithmic stock trading. Throughout my research I focused on exploring high-frequency trading algorithms, mainly because these are the types of algorithms that are employed at Wall Street hedge funds, and also the type I worked on at HeliosMI. Using QuantConnect, a backtesting platform for trading strategies, I developed my own version of three distinct algorithms; a momentum based strategy, a mean reversion based strategy, and a preferred time of day based strategy, all in C#. In my thesis report, I go in depth on each of these strategies, explaining the philosophy behind the strategy, delving into the code that makes up the strategy, and discuss the backtest results. The report also discusses the history of algorithmic trading, and explores some future research aspirations of mine.

			      <h4>NASA Psyche: Gaming Teamwork</h4>
			      <p>My senior year at ASU, I was placed on a Capstone team whose job was to complete a project for NASA’s Psyche Team. Our Capstone team was assigned to create two simulations for NASA Psyche’s Inclusive Mindset course, which aims to inform users about the benefits of diversity and teamwork in the workplace. These simulations are meant to engage the users, giving them a hopefully more appealing way to learn the lessons being taught in the course. Throughout the year as a team we worked in sprints using Java and Javascript to develop these simulations.

			      <h4>Asher Chaim Website</h4>
			      <p>Having just finished my undergraduate degree I was working for the real estate brokerage Asher Chaim as a junior software engineer. I was tasked with designing and building a website, and with exactly zero web dev experience, I accepted. In just 2 weeks I taught myself HTML and CSS and had a basic website deployed. In the weeks that followed I added web forms with spam/bot detection and data collection routing directly to an external CRM as contacts. In my free time during this project I designed a few logos for the company, mostly for fun, one of which was picked as the company's primary logo. For these efforts I was promoted to lead software engineer and was granted partner rights. Since then I have taken over the company's tech stack, and have made countless updates to the company site. </p>

			      <h4>Simple Blockchain Project</h4>
			      <p>This project models a simple (non-distributed) blockchain, with auto-generated transactions set to a fixed amount. Within the program, Merkle Trees are contrustructed from these transactions by a mining node. The mining node attempts to find a nonce that can be appended to the Merkle Root of the tree and SHA-256 hashed to be less than a set difficulty level 
               (itentionally set low since this project is just for demostration). When found, a block is created and added to the blockchain with the transactions used to generate the Merkle Tree, with the Merkle Root of the tree being used as the block identifier (stored within the block's header). The Merkle Root of the previous block is also stored in the block's header as a reference, allowing for quick and simple validataion of the entire chain. The next steps to this project would be the distribution of the mining node code (likely via docker) as well as a registration node, and the introduction of a wallet application for non-mining nodes to create transactions. This project was created for Introduction to Blockchain at University of Chicago.</p>

This project impliments a toggle-able menu with the music search tab and the about app tab.<br><br>
               This project also implements AWS Cognito User Pools to handle user sign in/out, and utilizes a docker container hosted on AWS Lightsail that contains a Quarkus microservice which connects to a MongoDB to manage different user's 'Favorites'. Finally, this project uses AWS SES (deployed via AWS Lambda and called through APIGateway) to send an email from the signed in user (or default@default.com if Cognito Validation is turned off) to me through the 'Contact' section of the 'About' page.
